# Homework 3 - React and Socket.IO

For HW3, I chose to work on the 2 tutorials, Tic-Tac-Toe and ChatBot which uses Socket.IO

(https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe)
(https://socket.io/get-started/chat)

## React - Tic-Tac-Toe

Code is `./hw3/react/` directory.

This is the classic game allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe.

## How to Run

All commmands reference the `./hw3/react/` directory. From the root directory of this repo, enter the react directory first:

```bash
cd ./hw3/react/
```

### Install Node Packages

```bash
npm install
```

### Run Tic-Tac-Toe on LocalHost

```bash
npm start
```

The Tic-Tac-Toe game will automatically be launched in your browser on LocalHost. [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

## Socket.IO ChatBot

Code can be found in the `./hw3/socketio/` directory.

This tutorial goes over a ChatBot application where the user is able to send and recieve messages displayed in browsers. It can be tested by opening the browser and going to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

## How to Run

All commmands reference the `./hw3/socketio/` directory. From the root directory of this repo, enter the react directory first:

```bash
cd ./hw3/socketio/
```

### Install Node Packages

```bash
npm install
```

### Chat on LocalHost

Start the chat server:

```bash
node index.js
```

Open a chat session (in browser). This can be run in multiple tabs/browsers on LocalHost to experience the multi-user "chat" experience. In a browser open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
